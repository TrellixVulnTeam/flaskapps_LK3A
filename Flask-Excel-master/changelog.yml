    details:
    - the intialization method has been modified. please call init_excel(app)  before
      you do anything else. This change was made in order to apply for  approved flask
      extension status. And by doing this change, it will support  multiple Flask
      apps and only the app that was initialized with init_excel  gets Flask-Excel
      and other apps in your BIG app won't get affected.
