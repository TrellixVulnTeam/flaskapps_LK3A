`Flask-Excel` - Let you focus on data, instead of file formats

Here is a typical conversation between the developer and the user::

 User: "I have uploaded an excel file"
       "but your application says un-supported file format"
 Developer: "Did you upload an xlsx file or a csv file?"
 User: "Well, I am not sure. I saved the data using "
       "Microsoft Excel. Surely, it must be in an excel format."
 Developer: "OK. Here is the thing. I were not told to support"
            "all available excel formats in day 1. Live with it"
            "or delay the project x number of days."

**Flask-Excel** is based on `pyexcel <https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel>`_ and makes
it easy to consume/produce information stored in excel files over HTTP protocol as
well as on file system. This library can turn the excel data into a list of lists,
a list of records(dictionaries), dictionaries of lists. And vice versa. Hence it
lets you focus on data in Flask based web development, instead of file formats.

The idea originated from the common usability problem: when an excel file
driven web application is delivered for non-developer users (ie: team assistant,
human resource administrator etc). The fact is that not everyone knows (or cares)
about the differences between various excel formats: csv, xls, xlsx are all
the same to them. Instead of training those users about file formats, this
library helps web developers to handle most of the excel file
formats by providing a common programming interface. To add a specific excel
file format type to you application, all you need is to install an extra pyexcel
plugin. Hence no code changes to your application and no issues with excel file
formats any more. Looking at the community, this library and its associated ones
try to become a small and easy to install alternative to Pandas.


The highlighted features are:

#. excel data import into and export from databases
#. turn uploaded excel file directly into Python data structure
#. pass Python data structures as an excel file download
#. provide data persistence as an excel file in server side
#. supports csv, tsv, csvz, tsvz by default and other formats are supported via
   the following plugins:

Plugin shopping guide
------------------------

Since 2020, all pyexcel-io plugins have dropped the support for python version
lower than 3.6. If you want to use any python verions, please use pyexcel-io
and its plugins version lower than 0.6.0.


Except csv files, xls, xlsx and ods files are a zip of a folder containing a lot of
xml files

The dedicated readers for excel files can stream read


In order to manage the list of plugins installed, you need to use pip to add or remove
a plugin. When you use virtualenv, you can have different plugins per virtual
environment. In the situation where you have multiple plugins that does the same thing
in your environment, you need to tell pyexcel which plugin to use per function call.
For example, pyexcel-ods and pyexcel-odsr, and you want to get_array to use pyexcel-odsr.
You need to append get_array(..., library='pyexcel-odsr').

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] zipped csv file
.. [#f2] zipped tsv file


This library makes information processing involving various excel files as easy as
processing array, dictionary when processing file upload/download, data import into
and export from SQL databases, information analysis and persistence. It uses
**pyexcel** and its plugins:

#. to provide one uniform programming interface to handle csv, tsv, xls, xlsx, xlsm and ods formats.
#. to provide one-stop utility to import the data in uploaded file into a database and to export tables in a database as excel files for file download.
#. to provide the same interface for information persistence at server side: saving a uploaded excel file to and loading a saved excel file from file system.



Installation
-------------------


You can install Flask-Excel via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install Flask-Excel


or clone it and install it:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/pyexcel-webwares/Flask-Excel.git
    $ cd Flask-Excel
    $ python setup.py install

Installation of individual plugins , please refer to individual plugin page. For example, if you need xlsx file support, please install pyexcel-xlsx::

        $ pip install pyexcel-xlsx


Setup
------------------------


In your application, you must import it before using it::

    import flask_excel as excel

    ...
    excel.init_excel(app) # required since version 0.0.7


Quick start
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A minimal application may look like this:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/tiny_example.py

The tiny application exposes four urls:

#. one for file upload
#. three urls for file download.

The first url presents a simple file upload html and responds
back in json with the content of the uploaded file. Here is an
`example file <https://github.com/pyexcel/Flask-Excel/blob/master/examples/example_for_upload.csv>`_
for testing but you can upload any other excel file. The file upload handler
uses `request.get_array` to parse the uploaded file and gets an array back.
The parameter **file** is coded in the html form::

    <input ... name=file>

.. warning::
   If 'field_name' was not specified, for example `request.get_array('file')`
   in upload_file() function, your browser would display "Bad Request: The
   browser (or proxy) sent a request that this server could not understand."

The rest of the links simply throw back a csv file whenever a http request is made to
http://localhost:50000/download/. :meth:`~excel.make_response_from_array` takes a
list of lists and a file type as parameters and sets up the mime type of the
http response. If you would like to give 'tsvz' a go, please change "csv" to
"tsvz".

And your issues will get prioritized if you would like to become my patreon as `pyexcel pro user`.

With your financial support, I will be able to invest
a little bit more time in coding, documentation and writing interesting posts.



More excel file formats
------------------------

The example application understands csv, tsv and its zipped variants: csvz and tsvz. If you would like to expand the list of supported excel file formats (see :ref:`file-format-list`) for your own application, you could install one or all of the following::

    pip install pyexcel-xls
    pip install pyexcel-xlsx
    pip install pyexcel-ods

.. warning::

   If you are using pyexcel <=0.2.1, you still need to import each plugin manually, e.g. `import pyexcel.ext.xls` and
   Your IDE or pyflakes may highlight it as un-used but it is used. The registration of
   the extra file format support happens when the import action is performed

Data import and export
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Continue with the previous example, the data import and export will be explained.
You can copy the following code in their own appearing sequence and paste them
after the place holder::

    # insert database related code here

Alternatively, you can find the complete example on
`github <https://github.com/pyexcel/Flask-Excel/blob/master/examples/database_example.py>`_

Now let's add the following imports first::

    from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy # sql operations

And please make sure that you have pyexcel-xls and pyexcel-handsontable installed::

	pip install pyexcel-xls, pyexcel-handsontable

Now configure the database connection. Sqllite will be used and **tmp.db** will
be used and can be found in your current working directory::

    app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///tmp.db'
    db = SQLAlchemy(app)

And paste some models from Flask-SQLAlchemy's documentation:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/database_example.py
   :lines: 38-69

Now let us create the tables in the database:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/database_example.py
   :lines: 71-73


Write up the view functions for data import:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/database_example.py
   :lines: 75-100

In the code, `category_init_func` and `post_init_func` are custom initialization
functions for Category and Post respectively. In the situation where you want to
skip certain rows, None should should be returned and flask_excel will ignore the row.


Write up the view function for data export:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/database_example.py
   :lines: 103-106

Then run the example again. Visit http://localhost:5000/import and upload
`sample-data.xls <https://github.com/pyexcel/Flask-Excel/blob/master/sample-data.xls>`_.

And it responds with

.. image:: _static/handson-view.png

This result is rendered via `pyexcel-handsontable <https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel-handsontable>`_.
All you needed is to put 'handsontable.html' as file type:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/database_example.py
   :lines: 115-119


Then visit http://localhost:5000/export to download the data back.

Export filtered query sets
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Previous example shows you how to dump one or more tables over http protocol.
Hereby, let's look at how to turn a query sets into an excel sheet. You can
pass a query sets and an array of selected column names to
:meth:`~flask_excel.make_response_from_query_sets` and generate an excel sheet from it:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/database_example.py
   :lines: 108-113

Then visit http://localhost:5000/custom_export to download the data
.. _data-types-and-its-conversion-funcs:

All supported data types
--------------------------

The example application likes to have array but it is not just about arrays. Here is table of functions for all supported data types:
