description = Play an animation via its name. Warning: Future versions of the app might change these, so for future-proofing we recommend using play_animation_trigger when it becomes available. See the remote_control.py example in apps for an easy way to see the available animations. Change the animation played by changing the app setting. Adapted for VectorCloud by rmountjoy.
