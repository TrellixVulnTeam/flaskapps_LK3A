An email sent to your alias {{alias.email}} from {{website_email}} was bounced by your mailbox {{mailbox_email}}.

This is usually because your mailbox service thinks the email is a spam.

You can view this email on {{ refused_email_url }}
The email is automatically deleted in 7 days.

Please consider the following options:

1. If the email is not spam at all, you can create a "filter" to explicitly allow this email
    or simply all emails from SimpleLogin.
    How to create the filter depends on your mailbox service.

2. If this email is spam, it means your alias {{alias}} is now in the hands of a spammer.
    You should disable or delete the alias immediately.
    We'll automatically disable this alias the second time the email is refused.

{{disable_alias_link}}

Thanks,
SimpleLogin team.
