Issues with {{ mailbox.email }}.

We have detected that your mailbox cannot reliably receive emails from SimpleLogin for a consecutive period of time.
The mailbox will be disabled in 5 days if the problem isn't solved by then.

Please note that a mailbox must be a "final" email address and cannot be
another email alias or a disposable email address.

If you have any question, you can reach out to us by replying to this email.

Best,
SimpleLogin Team.
