Hi,

You are about to submit a ~"feature request".

Here are a couple of rules to follow in order to get your request approved:

- Be polite
- Provide an accurate description of what you expect
- Don't forget to add the ~"feature request" label
- Keep in mind I work on Burp-UI on my spare time so it may take some time to
  get your feature request implemented

Thanks
