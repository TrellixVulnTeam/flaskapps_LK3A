Examples
========

The example data comes from Wes McKinney's presentation to PyCon Singapore:

To run the Flask app, just cd to the mcflyin folder, and enter the following on the command line: 

```
$python application.py
```

That should start up the app on localhost. 

Marty is an example Python front-end client for McFlyin. If you built out a client in another language, feel free to PR into this folder.
