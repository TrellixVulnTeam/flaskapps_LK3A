TODO

- Deploy by app name
    `propel --app myappname`
    `propel -w` will still mean all sites

- NO DOWN TIME FOR WEB DEPLOYMENT (not PHP, not HTML):
    Retrieve the active port of the current process from NGINX
    Keep the current process up
    Create a new process without creating a new nginx
    When new process is active, kill previous process and replace port
