Hello all! I am the creator of VectorCloud, a currently deprecated web interface for Vector.

For all of you that have tried/used VectorCloud, I apologize for my extended absence on this program. When I heard the news about Anki shutting down, I lost all motivation to continue sinking work into this project. In light of news about Digital Dream Labs continuing development of Vector, I plan to revive this project with a version 2.0.

Development of VectorCloud 2.0 can be tracked here:
https://github.com/rmountjoy92/VectorCloud2

Note: When VectorCloud2 is released, the code in this repo will be replaced with the VectorCloud2 code.
