Hi

Do you know you can send an email to anyone from your alias?
This below Youtube video walks you quickly through the steps:

Here are the steps:
1. First click "Send Email" on your alias you want to send email from
2. Enter your contact email, this will generate an "reverse-alias"
3. Use this reverse-alias instead of your contact email
4. Your contact will receive this email from your alias.

As usual, let me know if you have any question by replying to this email.

Best regards,
SimpleLogin Team.
