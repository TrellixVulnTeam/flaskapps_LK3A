{{ mailbox.email }} is disabled.

We have detected that your mailbox cannot reliably receive emails from SimpleLogin for a consecutive period of time.
The mailbox has been therefore disabled.
You can re-enable it by going to the mailbox page.

Please note that a mailbox must be a "final" email address and cannot be
another email alias or a disposable email address.

If you have any question, you can reach out to us by replying to this email.

Best,
SimpleLogin Team.
