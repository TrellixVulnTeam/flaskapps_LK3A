## Setting up for development
* clone the project: `git clone git@github.com:rosoftdeveloper/appseed.git`
* change directory to this project: `cd appseed/starter-vue/argon-design-system`
* (Optionally) start the backend server [starter-express](https://github.com/rosoftdeveloper/appseed/blob/master/starter-express/README.md) (default ip/port: `locahost:3000`)
* Default backend URL `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. This can be overwritten by updating the file: `src/views/Login.vue`

## Scripts

```

**Run**

**Production Build**
* `npm run build` - build the app in `dist` directory

**Test the production build**
`serve -s dist` - and visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser. You should see this [app](https://vuejs.appseed.us) running.
