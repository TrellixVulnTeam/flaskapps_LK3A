## Build the docs

The documentation is built with [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/)

`/docs` contains all the MD files that will be present for build.

`mkdocs.yml` contains the manifest of the site, including the navigation under `pages`
    
#### Install

```sh
pip install -r requirements-docs.txt
```

#### Serve local

```sh
mkdocs serve
```

#### Deploy to Github

```sh
mkdocs gh-deploy --clean
```

#### Edit Docs & pull requests

Edit the files that need updates or need to be created under `/docs`. Files
are in Markdown format. 

If you are adding a new doc file, you may want to put it in `mkdocs.yml` under
`pages` so it can be shown in the menu.


**Then commit and push your code in `master` to make a pull request.**

make sure `/site` folder is in the `.gitignore`. Because this folder is generated by MkDocs.

Do not COMMIT or PUSH the `/site` directory generated by MkDocs.
