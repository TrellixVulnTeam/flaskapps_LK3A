Step 2: Hello World
===================

This folder has a file called ``hello.py``, which contains a very basic
Flask application. When you run it, it will start a web server on your
computer. If you visit the web server using your browser, it will display
"Hello World".

Run this application like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python hello.py

You should see output that looks like this:

.. code-block::

    * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    * Restarting with stat

Open your web browser, and visit the URL ``http://127.0.0.1:5000/``. You should
see "Hello World!" in your browser.

Congratulations! You've just run a Flask application. If it was your first
time doing so, double-congrats! :)

Press ``CTRL+C`` to stop running the application. (That means, press and hold
the "control" key on your keyboard, and press the "c" key while still holding
"control". Then release both keys.)
