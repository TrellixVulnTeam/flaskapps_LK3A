Translating
-----------

Translations are very welcome!
If you are willing to help, you will need some tools:

::

    pip install Flask-Babel


Then you need to fork the project retrieve the sources:

::

    git clone https://git.ziirish.me/<your_login>/burp-ui.git
    cd burp-ui
    git submodule update --init
    pip install -r requirements.txt


You can have the list of available languages by running:

::

    ls burpui/translations


New language
^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your language is not listed, you can create a new translation running the
following command:

::

    ./tools/bui-manage init-translation <country_code> # where <country_code> can be "de", "ru", etc.


Update translation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to update an existing (and/or un-complete) translation, you probably
want to have a look at the *templates* files.

An un-translated file will contain things like:

::

    <h1>Some title</h1>


The string *Some title* won't be translated as is.
You need to update the template like this:

::

    <h1>{{ _('Some title') }}</h1>


Then you can update the translation files with the following command:

::

    ./tools/bui-manage update-translation


Translation
^^^^^^^^^^^

Now you can proceed the translation in the file
*burpui/translations/<country_code>/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po*.

It looks like:

::

    #: burpui/forms.py:18 burpui/templates/login.html:8
    msgid "Username"
    msgstr ""


You just have to put the translations in the *msgstr* line like:

::

    #: burpui/forms.py:18 burpui/templates/login.html:8
    msgid "Username"
    msgstr "Utilisateur"


Once it's done, you can push the sources and create a Merge Request on GitLab:

::

    git checkout -b translation-<country_code>
    git add burpui/translations/<country_code>/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po
    git commit -m "<country_code> translation"
    git push -u origin translation-<country_code>

All issues should contain the used command line to reproduce the problem, the
debug output and both versions of burp and ``Burp-UI`` you are using.

A Bug Report template is available directly in the Issue Tracker:

the following commands:

        burp-1.4.40

        burp-ui: v0.1.0.dev (90deb82c7b0be35f1a70bb073c9926b5947c6a85)
        $ burp-ui -v


Optionally your python version and your OS might be useful as well.
