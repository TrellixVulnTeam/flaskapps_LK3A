        <h2>Why packaging?</h2>
        <p>
            You might code up the very most awesomest game of them all but
            nopony may be able to play it only because you failed to package
            it correctly. The problems of packaging are manifold and
            treacherous. There are many different configurations, programming
            languages  and systems and you are only able to account for a
            limited number of those. Due to its inherent difficulty, this
            guide will focus on C++ for now. Other languages are usually
            much easier to package due to being interpreted as opposed to
            being compiled (see the example for python packaging).
        </p>

        <h2>C++ for Linux</h2>
        <p>
            On Linux, we need to try to stay distribution-neutral and thus
            we cannot make distribution-specific packages like <b>.rpm</b> or <b>.deb</b>.
            Instead, we'll focus on making self-contained universal packages that are well suited for game jams.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's say your game's executable is called <b>coolgame.bin</b>
            and you used g++ to compile it without any special flags. Now
            run <code class="term">$ ldd coolgame.bin</code> on that
            executable and you will see all dynamic libraries you explicitly
            or implicitly link against. Wow, they are quite many, aren't
            they? Let's try something, compile your game with
            <code class="term">$ g++ -static -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++</code>
            and run <i>ldd</i> on it again. Quite a lot less dynamies
            libraries will show up now as you just linked many things
            statically into the executable which in turn as grown in size.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moving on, to handle the remaining shared libraries, create a
            new directory beside your executable and call it "libs". Using
            ldd's output as a guideline, copy all remaining shared libraries
            into this directory. They may be quite numerous but don't worry
            about it. When time matters - as it happens to do in a game jam
             - we can't be too picky about redundancy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, make a little helper script, maybe call it "run.sh".
            It should have something like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>#!/bin/bash
current_dir="$(dirname $(readlink -f $0))"
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$current_dir/libs" ./coolgame.bin</code></pre>
        <p>
            Remember to make it all executable. You can now tar this up and
            it will work all nicely everywhere.
        </p>

        <h2>C++ for Windows</h2>
        <p>
            We will not be creating a nice installer here but rather a
            self-contained archive that people can just drop where ever
            they want and the game will run nonetheless. Make sure all
            required dlls are in the same place as the executable. If you
            are using mingw to cross-compile from linux, you should compile using
            <code class="term">$ g++ -static -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++</code>
            so that you will not need to copy as many dlls. If you use
            Microsoft Visual Studio, you will need to tell others to install
            the Microsoft C++ runtime before trying to run your game.
        </p>
        <p>
            Make sure to pack all
            into a zipfile as Windows users can unpack these without
            additional software.
        </p>

        <h2>Python</h2>
        <p>
            Python is a good example for interpreted languages. It is pretty
            easy to package, as you just need to deploy the source code
            and the included resources. <b>Other interpreted languages
            work pretty much the same.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Essentially, you copy your scripts and the resources to a
            folder, keeping your original directory structure. You can
            optionally write startup scripts (e.g. AwesomeGame.bat or
            AwesomeGame.sh) that execute your main python file, but usually
            marking the main file as such is sufficient. Users will have to
            run it from the terminal (Linux) or just double-click (Windows)
            the file to run your game.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you include other packages (such as <a href="http://pygame.org" target="_blank">pygame</a>) you should
            leave a dependency notice somewhere, preferably in a <b>README</b> file
            (or <b>README.txt</b> if you want Windows users to have it easy :D).
            Just give them a hint they need to install the package, and
            maybe leave a download link for convienience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, pack your folder into a zipfile or something similar
            (Linux users prefer tarballs) and upload it.
        </p>

        <h2>What about other frameworks / languages?</h2>
        <p>
            Most frameworks / game creation IDEs have their own file format
            (e.g. Blender, LÃ¶ve) or an export routine (e.g. Unity3D).
            Browse the FAQ of your software for details on deployment, or
            just google.
