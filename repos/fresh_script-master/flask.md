# fresh flask

This is an extension of the script utitlizing the flask web framework.

## activate the environment

Before you work on your project, activate the corresponding environment:
```
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install flask spotipy praw
```

## running flask
### linux/mac
To run the application you can either use the flask command or pythonâ€™s -m switch with Flask. Before you can do that you need to tell your terminal the application to work with by exporting the FLASK_APP environment variable:
```
$ export FLASK_APP=app.py
$ flask run
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```
Alternatively you can use ```python -m flask```:
```
$ export FLASK_APP=app.py
$ python -m flask run
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
``` 
### windows
If you are on Windows, the environment variable syntax depends on command line interpreter. On Command Prompt:
```
C:\path\to\app>set FLASK_APP=app.py
```
And on PowerShell:
```
PS C:\path\to\app> $env:FLASK_APP = "app.py"
```
### Debug Mode

(Want to just log errors and stack traces? See [Application Errors](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/errorhandling/#application-errors))

The flask script is nice to start a local development server, but you would have to restart it manually after each change to your code. That is not very nice and Flask can do better. If you enable debug support the server will reload itself on code changes, and it will also provide you with a helpful debugger if things go wrong.

To enable all development features (including debug mode) you can export the ```FLASK_ENV``` environment variable and set it to development before running the server:
```
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ flask run
```
(On Windows you need to use set instead of export.)

This does the following things:
- it activates the debugger
- it activates the automatic reloader
- it enables the debug mode on the Flask application.

You can also control debug mode separately from the environment by exporting ```FLASK_DEBUG=1```.

There are more parameters that are explained in the [Development Server](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/server/#server) docs.
This launches a very simple builtin server, which is good enough for testing but probably not what you want to use in production.
Now head over to http://127.0.0.1:5000/, and you should see your hello world greeting.
