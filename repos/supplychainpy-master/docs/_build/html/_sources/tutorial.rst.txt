2. and get ipython notebook up and running:


Integrated Development Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While several IDE's exist that can support this choice, it is the least favourable when working with Excel.


Ipython
^^^^^^^

The ipython notebook has many advantages including a consistent interface across both Mac and PC, easy saving of
notebooks and ability to share your work in various formats to name a few.

If you are unfamiliar with ipython and the suite of data analysis tools presented in the optional dependencies then
useful tools include: their respective websites, their documentation and the book
`Data Analysis <Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython>`_ by publisher O'Reilly.
The book is in its 1st edition (1 Nov 2012) but still very relevant and useful.


Inventory Analysis Example
==========================

Calculating the critical values for inventory analysis using a spreadsheet, often requires several steps. Extracting
transforming and loading (ETL) data, writing formulas, manual processes or pivot tables and in some cases vba. This
process is time consuming, repetitive, does not scale and could benefit from automation. Often the ETL is the first
part of to get automated, while the rise in self-service business intelligence tools help automate the reporting.
A comprehensive library in a productive language is a useful middle ground. Supplychainpy, Python and the extensive
python libraries hopefully fulfils the niche for rolling out a scalable and automated suite of analysis.
