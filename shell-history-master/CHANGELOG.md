## [0.2.0](https://github.com/pawamoy/shell-history/tags/0.2.0) - 2018-12-23

<small>[Compare with 0.1.0](https://github.com/pawamoy/shell-history/compare/0.1.0...0.2.0)</small>

- Package the application ([edaf15b](https://github.com/pawamoy/shell-history/commit/edaf15b7424d40ef13442be03ae04828eb80571d)).

  The application is now packaged as a Python package. It is easier to install and setup.
  - To install it: `pip install shellhistory`.
  - To enable it: `. $(shellhistory-location); shellhistory enable` at shell startup.

  **BREAKING CHANGES:**
  - The default directory in which `shellhistory` reads the history file and write the SQlite3 database file
  is now `~/.shellhistory` instead of `~/.shell_history`.
  - The SQlite3 database file is now named `db.sqlite3` instead of `db`.

    The migration is very easy:
    - rename the directory: `mv ~/.shell_history ~/.shellhistory`,
    - and the database file: `mv ~/.shellhistory/db ~/.shellhistory/db.sqlite3`.

    You can even skip renaming the database file:
    delete it and reimport your data with `shellhistory-cli --import`

  Please remember this application is alpha software, and is subject to change without guarantee of backward compatibility.
