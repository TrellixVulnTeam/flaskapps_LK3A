Welcome to Slackify's documentation!
====================================
:code:`Slackify` provides a declarative API to register handlers for Slack

- Commands
- Actions
- Events
- Shorcuts
- Modals
- Messages
- And more!

Its main focus is to make the task of developing slack bots **fun and fast**.

That's why it tries to hide all implementation details and offer a clean *flask-like* decorator syntax.
Hopefully, this will allow you to focus on the workflows you want to support,
instead of struggling with routing, endpoint or payload details.
